# ArchBang Installer
I need to take a few minutes and describe what this project was going to be and what it is turning into.  I started the project with the simple goal in mind of just replacing netctl in ArchBang with netcfg.  When I had issues editing the iso itself I started to modify the abinstall script that comes with ArchBang.  One thing led to another and now I am actually building a seperate distro of sorts.  I have to evaluate whether to continue with modifying this script or if I am going to give you guys a whole new way of installing an OpenRC Arch system.  For now I have formatting, and mounting of partitions working, and installation of the suite of software and tools.  I will probably keep editing and building this script for a little bit longer so dont worry about that.  I have more ideas about what I want to do with it.
